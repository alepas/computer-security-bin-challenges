# computer-security-bin-challenges
This repo has the aim to describe how to attack some vulnerable C codes given to students, as little challenges, during Computer Security lectures at Politecnico di Milano. Those challenges have been done in order to better understand how to find vulnerabilities inside code and to learn to develop secure code.
